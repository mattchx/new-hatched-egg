### Here is a breakdown of the five parts of this App :+1:

* 1) Fetch data from a JSON API, and present it on the screen (no styling).
--> DONE!!!!
* 2) Style the app using HTML and CSS.
--> DONE!!!!
* 3) Create a text field, and filter the list of data.
--> DONE!!!!
* 4) Display more information about the data fetched and create expandable views.
--> DONE!!!! (HALF)
* 5) Create text inputs for each item in the list, and be able to save information inputted data. Add more filtering capabilities.
- notes can me made for each user.
